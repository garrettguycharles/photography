        <p>I know on the homepage I said that I was "not just a photographer", but in reality, I'm not a photographer at all! I'm just a computer science student, and my real work has been the design and construction of this website. I typed every
          single line of code which went into making it.</p>
        <p>In fact, the only photo that is on this website that I made myself isn't even a photo: it's the rendering of the three-dimensional model of my logo that can be seen at the top of this page. (I <em>am</em> pretty proud of that one.)</p>
        <p>All of the attributions for the photos I used can be found in their respective HTML elements.</p>
        <p>But while I'm writing this blurb, I'll tell you about the picture! It was taken at the 2016 Bobby G awards in Colorado. I had been nominated for Best Actor for my role in my high-school's production of Les Mis&eacuterables. I didn't win, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCVFTwuSAk" target="_blank">here is a link</a> to a video of the nominees' performance at the event! My solo is at <a href="https://youtu.be/pUCVFTwuSAk?t=570" target="_blank">minute 9:30.</a> :)</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to review this site!</p>
